bshorhozer,False,True,I'm still confused  what would Pence pardon  45 for. If no charges have been laid ? If  45 loses the election &amp;  SDNY does not lay any charges until the changing of the guard   what is pence going to pardon  45 for? Pence will no longer have that power if the new gov. is sworn in,@bshorhozer @mmpadellan Not so. Ford pardoned Nixon before any charges had been brought. If Trump resigns  Pence could certainly pardon him for federal crimes. NYS and NYC still have state and local charges which a federal pardon won't apply to.,Capella A (with the sisters)

He waved a white flag. He walked away  he didn't do a damn thing. Think about it. Think about what he did not do. And it's almost criminal.",None
CTrain1967,False,False,@KeithPowersNYC Complete arbitrary call here.  See your 25% on September 30 and raise you to 50% on September 15.  Total nonsense.  When will someone stick up for the restaurants that make NYC a travel and commerce destination?,,None
